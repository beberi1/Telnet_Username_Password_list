# Use files with _variants if you want to have big list they have the most variants of default usernames and passwords
Passwords_variants.txt and Userames_variants.txt

# In Usernames.txt and Passwords.txt there are default usernames and passwords with which files with _ariants were created

## itertools.py is the code I used on Usernames.txt and Passwords.txt to create all variants from them.
## remove_duplicate.py can be used to remove dublicates
